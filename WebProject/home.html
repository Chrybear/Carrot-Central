			<blockquote>
				<p>
					"I started growing carrots before I could even read. And while I can now read at a semi-literate
					level, I am still growing carrots. Carrot Central's seeds are extremely expensive but they grow tasty carrots."
					<br />
					&#8212;<cite>John Goodburger, Local Elvis impersonator</cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					"Carrots are the ultimate survival food. Hearty, nutritious, fairly easy to grow, and bright orange. 
					Perfectly tubular for storage. You can make so many different foods, from salads, pastries, roasts, or just eat them raw.
					I buy from Carrot Central because they know their carrots and don't ask many questions."
					<br />
					&#8212;<cite>Lt. Carl Fertinborg, Unknown (we didn't ask)</cite>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					"With each additional carrot I consume the stronger I become. I can feel the carotene coursing through me. 
					The more carrots I eat the more of their secrets they reveal to me. Soon I will be complete.
					I buy from Carrot Central because they are close by to where I live."
					<br />
